# SQL PROJECT-BLINKIT

Blinkit is a reputed online grocery store that uses MySQL to analyze their data and make informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging MySQL, they track sales trends, analyze customer behavior, and identify areas for improvement.

## Purpose of Data Analysis
The primary goals of Blinkit's data analysis are:

-Sales Trends Tracking: Analyzing sales data for product categories or comparing sales figures across different outlets to identify areas needing focus to increase sales.

-Customer Behavior Analysis: Gathering data on customer behavior and preferences to understand purchase histories and identify frequently bought products together.

-Customer Feedback Analysis: Gaining insights from customer feedback to understand what customers look for in a grocery store.

## The 'Grocery Sales' Table
To achieve these goals, Blinkit uses the 'Grocery Sales' table, which contains the following 12 columns:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each item.

Item_Weight: Weight of the item.

Item_Fat_Content: Fat content of the item.

Item_Visibility: Visibility of the item on the shelf.

Item_Type: Type/category of the item.

Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price of the item.

Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for each outlet.

Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year when the outlet was established.

Outlet_Size: Size of the outlet.

Outlet_Location_Type: Location type of the outlet (e.g., Urban, Suburban).

Outlet_Type: Type of the outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket).

Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the item at the outlet.

## Query to identify frequently purchased items:
-SELECT Item_Identifier, COUNT(*) as Frequency
FROM Grocery_Sales
GROUP BY Item_Identifier
ORDER BY Frequency DESC;

-SELECT Item_Type, SUM(Item_Outlet_Sales) as Total_Sales
FROM Grocery_Sales
GROUP BY Item_Type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;

-SELECT *
FROM Customer_Feedback
WHERE Item_Identifier = 'ITEM_ID';

## Results and Insights
